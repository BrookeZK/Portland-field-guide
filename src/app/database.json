Deciduous trees are also found such as alder and bigleaf maple. The shrub layer is dominated by vine maple, Oregon grape, and Indian plum. Groundcover plants will vary based on how much sunlight and moisture reaches  the forest floor. The dominant groundcover is sword fern. Forest soils tend to be moist and rich in humus. At present, the remaining forested areas in Portland contain a strong deciduous component. This is more a reflection of the current successional stage resulting from recent (last 150 years) mass disturbance from logging, fires, and development."

The dominant trees are black cottonwood, Oregon ash, various willows, and red alder, all of which can quickly recover from periodic flooding. On higher ground which floods less frequently Bigleaf maple and Oregon White Oak are common. Western red cedars appear in the transition zones between the lowlands and the forested bluffs overlooking the rivers. This is a dynamic community that responds to periodic flooding and high disturbance; floods which can rip trees out of the ground or bury them with sediment. Plants are typically fast growing and can readily reestablish themselves after a disturbance."

At some of these riparian or wetland edges, shrubs predominate and can form dense thickets of willows, rose, and Redosier dogwood.

The ground water levels are generally very near to the surface, and may be accentuated by the presence of poorly draining soils and the seasonal flooding of nearby waterways.

    "description": "Historically, these areas were burned by Native Americans, which helped to maintain their open, grassy character. There are very few examples of this type of community in the Portland area. Prairies are comprised primarily of grasses on well drained dry upland sites. If trees and shrubs are present, they are typically found singularly or in small groups and are tolerant of the shallow dry soils and sunny exposed conditions. These areas may include grassy knolls, treeless south facing slopes, and well drained grassland. The number of trees or shrubs present will depend on the depth of the soil and available moisture. Oak savanna is a community that is no longer in existence in the Portland area. It was much like the prairie community except there were a greater number of trees present. The greater frequency of trees would likely have changed the assemblage of species growing under them but there is little information available to indicate what that assemblage may have been."
